# Country Segmentation Unsupervised Machine Learning
Unsupervised Machine Learning
# Introduction
This task involves the application of machine learning clustering algorithms, specifically the k-means and Mean-Shift model, to a country dataset containing economic and social indicators. Unsupervised machine learning is utilised to unveil hidden patterns within the data, with clustering being a prevalent technique for identifying groupings in a dataset with features and observations.
K-means, a centroid-based clustering algorithm, involves setting a predetermined number of clusters (k) and assigning each data point in the dataset to these clusters based on Euclidean distance. The algorithm iteratively recalculates the centroids' positions by computing the mean of all data points assigned to each cluster until an optimal fit is achieved[3], [4]. Mean-Shift, in contrast, does not require a predefined number of clusters. Instead, it assigns each data point to the peaks it identifies in the dataset, focusing on locating high-density areas. This makes Mean-Shift particularly valuable when the number of clusters is unknown[5].
## Model Construction and Implementation
Data undergoes pre-processing and exploratory analysis to ensure suitability. Key features, such as exports (range 0 to 200) and imports (range 0 to 174), exhibit a high positive correlation. Child mortality ranges from 2 to 208. A simple k-means algorithm is deployed, clustering based on child mortality and exports. The Elbow plot technique (see Task_2A.py) identifies 5 optimal clusters after experimenting with random k- number of clusters. Child mortality and export features were also chosen for the Mean-Shift algorithm. Without a predefined number of clusters, the Mean-Shift model was deployed and fitted to the X variable containing both features, resulting in the identification of three clusters with three centroids.

## Observations: 
K-means model has successfully grouped the dataset into five clusters, as determined by the optimal number of k cluster identified in the elbow plot for child mortality and exports. Cluster 3 represents countries with child mortality below 50 and low exports, indicative of good healthcare, nutrition, sanitation, and socio-economic conditions but limited international market resources. Cluster 0 emerges as the most favourable, comprising countries with child mortality below 50 and high exports. Cluster 2 exhibits better child mortality rates and substantial exports. Cluster 4 is characterized by child mortality rates between 50-100 and poor exports (0 to 25). Cluster 1 contains countries performing poorly in both child mortality and exports, with a few outliers demonstrating average export performance.
     
## Comparison of Mean-Shift and k-Means
Mean-Shift and k-Means produce different outcomes. While k-Means declares around 5 optimal clusters based on elbow plot technique, Mean-Shift tends to favour a more effective clustering into three, expressing a belief in achieving better results with its approach of identifying peaks or high density in our dataset.
When evaluating the results of k-Means and Mean-Shift models based on this input variables, it is observed that k-Means with 5 clusters provides more insights and patterns in grouping data points. However, both models exhibit similar outcomes for k-Means cluster 0 and Mean-Shift cluster 1. Similar observations are noted when pairing other two features, such as import and exports, with k-Means and its elbow plot technique suggesting 3 clusters as the optimal choice, whereas Mean-Shift reports 4 clusters with most data points in its cluster 0 unlike k-means and it created a single-data-point cluster, cluster 3(see Task_2B.py). Various combinations of double features were explored to identify patterns, as detailed in (see Task_2A and 2B.py), before progressing to testing with more than two features, aiming to gain additional insights and a clearer pattern in the data.
Model Progression
Using the same k-means and mean-shift algorithms with changes in the number of features (this time 3), we applied the algorithms to obtain groupings for patterns and insights. When comparing the results of k-means and mean-shift for grouping based on child mortality, health, and exports features. K-means clustering suggested an optimal number of clusters to be 6, as shown in Figure 4. However, mean-shift indicated three clusters for these three features. Through our interactive plot, it became apparent that a data point with child mortality of 7.3, exports of 12.4, and health of 17.9 was assigned to cluster 1 in k-means but to cluster 0 in mean-shift. Mean-shift appeared to consolidate clusters 5, 4, and 1 of k-means into a single cluster (cluster 0), exhibiting a high density of data points.

# Model evaluation and Recommendations
The K-means elbow plot technique, initially used to determine the optimal number of clusters, was further assessed using silhouette score for accuracy verification. More features from the dataset were incorporated,
    
and both K-means and mean-shift models were applied to gain further insights, proving to be beneficial see Task_2A and 2B.py). Throughout the algorithmic procedure, both models consistently identified a cluster with 3 or 4 data points, signifying the best-performing countries based on economic and social indicators. Further Python analysis, by assigning these clusters to the full dataset, revealed these countries to be Luxembourg, Switzerland, Qatar, and Singapore. Occasionally, a fifth country, Norway, was also identified
